A framework for building bots.

The key to automating any task is detecting the current state of the environment (the computer desktop for example), performing actions, detecting any changes in state and then performing more actions based on the new state. Botticelli provides a state machine implementation for defining behaviour and a series of utility packages that can be used to actually perform actions and detect state.
